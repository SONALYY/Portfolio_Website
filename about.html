      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m <strong>Sahana B</strong>, a final-year student pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Mangalore Institute of Technology and Engineering.
        With a strong foundation in core programming and problem-solving, I’ve spent the last few years developing skills that sit at the intersection of intelligence, innovation, and impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical interests revolve around <strong>Python development</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Web Development</strong>, and <strong>backend systems</strong> related to AI-driven applications. I'm comfortable working with frameworks like <em>TensorFlow</em> and enjoy building ML pipelines, REST APIs, and intelligent dashboards that drive smart decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my AI/ML journey, I’m also a <strong>cybersecurity enthusiast</strong> with a keen interest in ethical hacking, system vulnerabilities, and digital defense mechanisms. This blend of intelligence and security enables me to approach development with a unique perspective — building not just efficient, but also safe and secure systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in constant learning, collaboration, and contributing to real-world solutions. My future ambition is to grow into a role like <strong>AI Solutions Architect</strong> or a <strong>Machine Learning Security Engineer</strong> where I can bring together AI and cybersecurity to build resilient, impactful tech ecosystems.
